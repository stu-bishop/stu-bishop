### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a climate scientist who specializes in physical oceanography, serving as an assistant professor in the department of Marine, Earth, & Atmospheric Sciences at NC State University.  My faculty page is [here](https://meas.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/spbishop/) and a link to my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g-_lrUMAAAAJ&hl=en).  I am interested in large-scale ocean and atmospheric circulation and how different scales of motion from turbulence to global scales influence our climate through air-sea interaction.  Beyond my professional pursuits, I engage in compelling hobby projects, particularly in the realms of Data Science and Machine Learning (ML), a few of which are showcased here.  In addition to my dedication to climate science, I am a cryptocurrency enthusiast, delving into the realm of price prediction for various cryptocurrencies. I am currently developing two Vector Autoregression (VAR) ML models: 1) to predict upwelling events along the outer banks (OBX) of North Carolina and 2) to predict cryptocurrency prices.  While my primary coding language is Python, I maintain a curiosity for Rust and utilize SQL for efficient data querying.  In my free time you'll either find me with my wife and dog on the coast where we are avid surfers or in the mountains chasing powder in winter and backpacking in summer.  My surfing pursuits have taken me to some amazing places, including Mircronesia (my favorite), Indonesia, Costa Rica, Brazil, and Hawaii.
