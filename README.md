### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a physical oceanographer and an assistant professor in the department of Maine, Earth, & Atmospheric Sciences at NC State University.  My faculty page is [here](https://meas.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/spbishop/) and a link to my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g-_lrUMAAAAJ&hl=en).  I am interested in large-scale ocean and atmospheric circulation and how ocean turbulence influences our global climate through air-sea interaction.  My hobby projects outside of work include Data Science and Machine Learning (ML) problems, of which some are showcased here.  I am a cryptocurrency enthusiast and I have some work here on price prediction of different cryptocurrencies.  I primarily work in Python, but I am Rust curious and use SQL to query data.
