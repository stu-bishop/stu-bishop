### Hi there 👋

I am a climate scientist who specializes in physical oceanography, serving as an assistant professor in the department of Maine, Earth, & Atmospheric Sciences at NC State University.  My faculty page is [here](https://meas.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/spbishop/) and a link to my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g-_lrUMAAAAJ&hl=en).  I am interested in large-scale ocean and atmospheric circulation and how different scales of motion from ocean turbulence to global scales influence our climate through air-sea interaction.  Beyond my professional pursuits, I engage in compelling hobby projects, particularly in the realms of Data Science and Machine Learning (ML), a few of which are showcased here.  I am currently working on a Vector Autoregression (VAR) ML model to predict upwelling events along the outer banks (OBX) of North Carolina.  In addition to my dedication to climate science, I am an avid cryptocurrency enthusiast, delving into the realm of price prediction for various cryptocurrencies. While my primary coding language is Python, I maintain a curiosity for Rust and utilize SQL for efficient data querying.
